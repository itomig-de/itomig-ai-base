We designed this framework to be as simple as possible, while still providing you with the tools you need to build powerful apps.
It is compatible with Symfony and Laravel.

We are working to expand the support of different LLMs. Right now, we are supporting [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [Atlas Cloud](https://www.atlascloud.ai/docs) and services compatible with the OpenAI API such as [LocalAI](https://localai.io/).
Ollama that can be used to run LLM locally such as [Llama 2](https://llama.meta.com/).

We want to thank few amazing projects that we use here or inspired us:

-   the learnings from using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [LLamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
-   the excellent work from the [OpenAI PHP SDK](https://github.com/openai-php/client).
